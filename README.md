# Retinal blood vessel segmentation employing image processing and data mining techniques for computerized retinal image analysis

# Abstract
The majority of retinal disorders, including retinopathy, occlusion, etc., can be diagnosed by observing changes in the retinal vasculature in fundus images. Consequently, segmentation of retinal blood vessels aids in the detection of the abnormalities and, consequently, the disease. Manual segmentation of vessels needs competence. As vessels are only a few pixels wide and span practically the entire width of the fundus picture, this is an extremely laborious and time-consuming process. Using computational methods for this purpose might improve the efficiency of retinal analysis. This paper proposes an approach that sequentially applies picture pre-processing, supervised and unsupervised learning, and image post-processing techniques. During the pre-processing stage, image cropping, color transformation and color channel extraction, contrast enhancement, Gabor filtering, and halfwave rectification are consecutively applied.
Images that have been preprocessed yield a feature vector. The feature vector is subjected to a principal component analysis. On this output, K-means clustering is done to classify pixels as either vessel or non-vessel clusters. The detected non-vessel group is subjected to an ensemble classification process utilizing a root-guided decision tree with bagging, whereas the vessel group is left unprocessed because additional processing could lead to an increase in the misclassification of vessels as non-vessels. Combining the results of the clustering and ensemble classification processes produces the segmented image. The output of the preceding phase's vascular segmentation is post-processed using morphological approaches. The proposed method is validated with photos from the publicly accessible DRIVE database. The proposed method yields an accuracy of 95.36 percent, which is equivalent to the known strategies for segmenting blood vessels.
